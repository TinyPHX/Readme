# Readme
Readme component for Unity, attachable to any GameObject to document what you can't in a script or the file system.

## Welcome to the Readme for the Readme project!

Project is meant to allow users the ability to better document Unity GameObjects as whole. Currently, the main ways yous can include documentation in your unity project are

 * With a readme in your file system
 * With comments in your code

This leaves a gap in the documentation. What do you do when your GameObject requires some simple notes that are not related to an individual script? Or what if you just really want to make sure someone knows why you've configured a component they way you have?

Well now we have a readme for components!
