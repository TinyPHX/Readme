Last updated: March 14, 2022
1. PARTIES TO THE AGREEMENT/THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THE AGREEMENT:
1.1
This Tiny Phoenix Store End User License Agreement (hereinafter referred to as “EULA”) is a non-exclusive, legally binding end user license agreement between any individual or a single entity (“END-USER”) that acquires an Asset from the Tiny Phoenix Store and either (i) Tiny Phoenix, 1295 North Ash Street, Gilbert, Arizona 85233 (“Licensor” or "Tiny Phoenix"), or as the case may be (ii) any third party (“Provider”) that distributes its Assets from the Tiny Phoenix Store. Consequently, this EULA shall apply regardless of whether a purchased Asset is produced by Tiny Phoenix or by a Provider ("Licensor"). This EULA is therefore a non-exclusive, legally binding end user license agreement as the case may be between either (i) Tiny Phoenix and END-User (in which case the term "Licensor" shall refer to Tiny Phoenix), or (ii) Provider and End User (in which case the term "Licensor" shall refer to Provider).
1.2
By installing, copying, accessing, downloading or otherwise using the Assets, End User agrees to be bound the provisions of this EULA. All definitions of the Terms shall also apply in this EULA unless the context clearly provides for a different understanding.
1.3
The subject matter of this EULA is the licensing to END-USER of any Asset acquired by End User from the Tiny Phoenix Store. The Assets are licensed, not sold.
1.4
END USER hereby acknowledges that in the event it acquires an ASSET which in the Tiny Phoenix Store is marked as an Asset which is distributed by Provider (as opposed to Tiny Phoenix), then Provider shall be considered as Licensor of such Asset and, consequently, only Provider (as opposed to Tiny Phoenix) shall be responsible for any liability whatsoever under, any EULA or any breach by Provider, including (without limitation) liability for infringement of any intellectual property rights, irrespective of the fact that payment takes place to Tiny Phoenix.
2. END-USER'S RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS
